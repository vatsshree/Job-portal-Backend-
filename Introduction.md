# Job Portal Backend

## Introduction

This project is a backend application for a Job Portal developed using **NestJS**, **MongoDB**, and **JWT Authentication**. The objective of this project is to provide a secure REST API that allows users to register, authenticate, create job postings, and apply for available jobs while maintaining proper role-based access control.

The application supports two types of users:

* **Recruiter** – Can create, update, view, and delete job postings, and view applications submitted for their jobs.
* **Job Seeker** – Can browse available jobs and apply for them.

## Features

* User Registration and Login
* JWT-based Authentication
* Password Hashing using bcrypt
* User Profile Update and Delete
* Role-Based Authorization (Recruiter / Seeker)
* Job CRUD Operations
* Apply for Jobs
* View Submitted Applications
* Recruiters can View Applications for Their Jobs
* MongoDB Database Integration using Mongoose

## Technology Stack

* NestJS
* TypeScript

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture:

* **Jobs Module** – Job creation and management.
* **Application Module** – Job application management.

## Future Improvements

* Orderly role guards using custom decorators.
